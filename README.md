#  Quantum Algorithms with Qiskit

This project implements :

-  **Shor’s Algorithm** for integer factorization  

##  Shor’s Algorithm – Factorization

Shor’s algorithm : factor large integers exponentially faster than classical algorithms.

- Uses **quantum period finding** and the **Quantum Fourier Transform**
- Employs classical pre- and post-processing for factor extraction
- Capable of factoring small numbers like 15 and 21 using simulators
